A sample of test scenarios performed on the system:

--------ELECTION--------

Start 2 servers:
    Expect: exactly 1 server becomes the coordinator
Stop the coordinator:
    Expect: the other server becomes the coordinator

Start 2 servers:
    Expect: exactly 1 server becomes the coordinator
Start a 3rd server:
    Expect: another election is held and exactly 1 server becomes the coordinator

Start 3 servers:
    Expect: exactly 1 server becomes the coordinator
Stop a backup server:
    Expect: no election is held

Start 3 servers:
    Expect: exactly 1 server becomes the coordinator
Stop the coordinator:
    Expect: another election is held and exactly 1 server becomes the coordinator

--------REPLICATION--------
Start 3 servers:
Client connects to coordinator and creates an account:
    Expect: the coordinator creates the account and the backup servers replicate the account
Client connects to a backup server and creates an account:
    Expect: the backup server forwards the request to the coordinator, the coordinator creates the account and the other backup server replicates the change
Client looks up the account on any server:
    Expect: the account is found in the servers local data without need to contact the coordinator.

--------RELIABILITY/RECOVERY--------
Start 2 servers:
Client creates an account:
    Expect: the account is created on both servers
Start a 3rd server:
    Expect: the 3rd server replicates the account data from the coordinator
Stop the first 2 servers:
    Expect: the 3rd server continues to serve the account data and becomes the coordinator
    Expect: no data is lost
Start the first 2 servers:
    Expect: the 3rd server replicates the account data to the first 2 servers
    Expect: no data is lost
    Expect: a single coordinator is elected

--------SYNCHRONIZATION--------
If two events are received out of order by a backup server,
the backup server should be able to reorder the events and apply them in the correct order.
This was not explicitly tested as it is difficult to replicate.
However, the design of the system should allow for this to work correctly.

--------MISC--------
Expect: all client operations work as expected regardless of which server they connect to.
